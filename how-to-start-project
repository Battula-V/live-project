    2.Analysis(Here we will decide What technology,servers are to be used . Also cost estimation)
    3.Designing(Here based on the requirement some rough screens have to be prepared using paper(or)paint(or)photoshop)
    4.Development(It is purely based on requirement and designing. Coding will be done as per designing)
    5.Testing(A team of testers will test designing and development happens as per requirement. A tool called JIRA is used by testers)
    6.Delirvery and installation(Once testing completed software will be delivered to the client)
    7.Maintanance(After delivering the project if any issues arraises client will ask for changes and client will pay for the changes)
