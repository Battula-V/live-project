Instance Variables:
================
A variable that is defined as a member of a class is called 
as an instance variable.

Memory allocated to instance variables whenever an 
object is created.

Separate copy of instance variable exist for every object.

Instance variable can be accessed by using an object 
reference.

Instance variable can be accessed in instance method
by using this keyword.

this keyword refers current object.

Instance variables can be initialized by using constructor
method.

Instance Method:
===============
A method that is defined as a member of a class is called as
an instance method.

Constructor Method:
=================
It is a special method which name is constructor() only.

<!-- Program to demonstrate instance variables -->
<html>
<body>
<script>
class Emp
{
	empNo=101;
	salary=5000.00;
}
let e=new Emp();
document.write(e.empNo+"<br>"+e.salary);
</script>
</body>
</html>

<!-- Program to demonstrate instance method -->
<html>
<body>
<script>
class Emp
{
	empNo=101;
	salary=5000.00;
	display()
	{
		document.write(this.empNo+"<br>"+this.salary);
	}
}
let e=new Emp();
e.display();
</script>
</body>
</html>

<!-- Program to demonstrate constructor -->
<html>
<body>
<script>
class Emp
{
	constructor(empNo, salary)
	{
		this.empNo=empNo;
		this.salary=salary;
	}
	display()
	{
	document.write(this.empNo+"<br>"+this.salary+"<br>");
	}
}
let e1=new Emp(101, 5000.00);
let e2=new Emp(102, 6000.00);
let e3=new Emp(103, 7000.00);
e1.display();
e2.display();
e3.display();
</script>
</body>
</html>

Class Variables:
==============
A variable that is defined as a static member of a class is 
called as class variable.

Class variables memory allocated whenever class is loaded.

Only one copy of class variable exist for all objects.

Class variable can be accessed by using class name.

Note: If the value is different for every object then use 
instance variable, if the value is same for all objects then 
use class variable.

Class Method:
============
A method that is defined as a static member of a class is
called as class method.

<!-- Program to demonstrate class variable & class method -->
<html>
<body>
<script>
class Demo
{
	static x=10;
	static display()
	{
		document.write(Demo.x);
	}
}
Demo.display();
</script>
</body>
</html>

Encapsulation:
=============
Binding of variables & methods into a class is known as
an encapsulation.

Abstraction:
===========
Providing necessary information & hiding unnecessary 
information is called as an abstraction.

<!-- Program to demonstrate Encapsulation & Abstraction -->
<html>
<body>
<script>
class Student
{
	constructor(rollNo, name, marks)
	{
		this.rollNo=rollNo;
		this.name=name;
		this.marks=marks;
	}
	static institute_name="Naresh IT";
	display()
	{
		document.write(this.rollNo, this.name, this.marks, Student.institute_name,"<br>");
	}
}
let s1=new Student(1,"aaa",83);
let s2=new Student(2,"bbb",89);
s1.display();
s2.display();
</script>
</body>
</html>

Inheritance:
==========
Creating a new class from an existing class is called as an
inheritance.

In inheritance, existed class is said to be super class & new
class is said to be sub class.

Whenever super class object is created then memory 
allocated to super class members only.

Whenever sub class object is created then memory allocated
to both super class & sub class members.
