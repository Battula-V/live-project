Java Script HTML DOM:
==================
The HTML DOM(Document Object Model) is created by browser whenever a web page is loaded.
The HTML DOM is created as a tree of objects.

For example:
==========
demo.html
========
<html>
<head>
<title>Home Page</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="yellow" text="red">
<h1>Welcome</h1>
</body>
</html>

The DOM tree created by browser for the above html document as follows:
Document(demo.html) => Root Element(<html>)=>Element(<head>) & 
Element(<body>)
Element(<head>) => Element(<title>) => Text("Home Page")
Element(<body>) => Element(<h1>), Attribute(bgcolor="yellow") & Attribute(text="red")
Element(<h1>) => Text("Welcome")

Java Script can access all html elements, attributes & content of an html document.

Java Script can do the following on html document:
1) It can change the content of html elements.
2) It can change the values of html attributes.
3) It can change the css styles.
4) It can add new html elements & attributes.
5) It can remove existing html elements & attributes.
6) It can create new html events.
7) It can react to all existing html events.

HTML DOM methods are used to perform actions on html elements.
HTML DOM properties are used to change the values of html elements.

Example:
=======
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML="Welcome";

In the above example, getElementById() is a method & innerHTML is a property.

The following methods are used to find the html elements:
1) document.getElementById(id) => It is used to find an element by element id.
2) document.getElementsByTagName(name) => It is used to find elements by tag name. 
3) document.getElementsByClassName(name) => It is used to find elements by class name.
4) document.querySelectorAll(selector) => It is used to find elements by selector.

The following properties are used to change the html elements:
1) element.innerHTML=new HTML content => It is used to change the content.
2) element.attribute=new value => It is used to change the attribute value.
3) element.style.property=new style => It is used to change the style 

The following methods are used to add & remove elements:
1) document.createElement(element) => It is used to create an element.
2) document.appendChild(element) => It is used to add an element.
3) document.removeChild(element) => It is used to remove an element.
4) document.replaceChild(new, old) => It is used to replace an element.

The following methods are used to add & remove event listeners:
1) element.addEventListener(event, function) => It is used to add event listener
2) element.removeEventListener(event, function) => It is used to remove event listener
