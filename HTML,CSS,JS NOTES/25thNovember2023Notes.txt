1) Modularity

Functions are used to perform the task.
Generally functions are divided into four categories:
1) Functions with arguments & with return value.
2) Functions with arguments & without return value.
3) Functions without arguments & with return value.
4) Functions without arguments & without return value.

<html>
<body>
<script>
function add(a, b)
{
	return a+b;
}
let x=add(34,93);
document.write(x);
</script>
