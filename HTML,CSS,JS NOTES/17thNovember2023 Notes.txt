1) Arithmetic Operators(6 Binary)
2) Relational Operators(8 Binary)
3) Logical Operators(2 Binary & 1 Unary)
4) Increment & Decrement Operators(2 Unary)

Logical Operators:
================
	Operator		Meaning
	========		========
	     &&		Logical AND
	      ||		Logical OR
	       !		Logical NOT

<html>
<body>
<script>
let a=5, b=3, c=2;
let d=!((a>b)&&(a>c));
let e=(a>b)||(a>c);
document.write(d);
document.write(e);
</script>
</body>
</html>
     
Types of Operators:
=================
There are 3 types of operators:
1) Unary Operator
2) Binary Operator
3) Ternary Operator

Unary Operator:
==============
An operator that operates on only one operand is called as
unary operator.
Here operand can be a variable, literal or expression.

Binary Operator:
==============
An operator that operates on two operands is called as
binary operator.

Ternary Operator:
===============
An operator that operates on three operands is called as
ternary operator.

Increment & Decrement Operators:
==============================
	Operator		Meaning
	========		=======
	     ++		Increment By 1
	      --		Decrement By 1

	++a => Pre increment
	a++ => Post increment
	--a => Pre decrement
	a-- => Post decrement

<html>
<body>
<script>
let a=10, b=3;
let c=a++ + ++b;
document.write(a,b,c);
</script>
</body>
</html>

Bitwise Operators:
================
	Operator		Meaning
	========		=======
	      &		Bitwise AND
	       |		Bitwise OR
	       ^		Bitwise XOR
	      <<		Left Shift
	      >>		Right Shift
	      ~		Complement (tilde)

The above all bitwise operators operate on binary data.
