Regular Expressions:
==================
Regular expression is a search pattern that is used to search
a specified pattern in a specified text & it is also used to
replace the text.

It is required to validate forms. It is also used in web 
scrapping applications.

There are two ways to create search pattern:
======================================
1) By using regular expression literal.
2) By using constructor RegExp() function.

1) By using relular expression literal:
===============================
Example:
========
let pattern=/welcome/;

2) By using constructor RegExp() function:
====================================
Example:
========
let pattern=new RegExp("Welcome");

13) "ab+c" => It means b one or more times.
14) "ab?c" => It means b zero or one time.
15) "ab{3}c" => It means b 3 times.
16) "ab{3,6}c" => It means b minimum 3 times & maximum 6 
times.
17) [0-9]{3} => It means any three digits number.
18) [1-5][6-9] => It means first digit 1 to 5 & second digit 6 to 9.
